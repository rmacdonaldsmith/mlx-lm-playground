Payment Processing System Requirements

Our e-commerce platform needs a secure payment form that collects and validates customer payment information. The system must ensure data integrity and provide clear user feedback.

Key Features:
- Credit card number validation using industry-standard Luhn algorithm
- US ZIP code validation for billing addresses  
- Real-time validation feedback with clear error messages
- Secure handling of sensitive payment information
- Mobile-responsive design for cross-platform compatibility

User Flow:
1. Customer enters payment information on checkout form
2. System validates inputs in real-time as user types
3. Clear error messages guide user to correct invalid inputs
4. Successfully validated payment information is securely processed
5. Customer receives confirmation of successful payment processing

Security Requirements:
- All payment data must be encrypted in transit and at rest
- PCI compliance for credit card handling
- No sensitive data logged in application logs
- Session timeout for payment forms after 15 minutes of inactivity

Performance Requirements:
- Validation feedback must appear within 200ms of user input
- Form submission must complete within 3 seconds
- System must handle 1000+ concurrent payment validations

Error Handling:
- Invalid credit card numbers should show specific validation errors
- Missing required fields should be clearly highlighted
- Network errors should provide retry options with exponential backoff
- System errors should fallback gracefully without exposing sensitive data
